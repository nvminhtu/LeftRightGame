A practice project using AngularJS that I'm putting together after a coworker said I should make my own attempt at a game he created.

The game displays two boxes, left and right, and prompts the user to click either side.  Points are awarded for clicking the correct side.

You can see a demo of this game at http://nicholasdupuis.github.io/LeftRightGame
